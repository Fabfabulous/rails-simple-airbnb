Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

Background & Objectives
We want to build a simple airbnb clone (like this one : https://rails-simple-airbnb.herokuapp.com/). These should be all the user stories of our app:

As a user, I can see all the available flats on our website
As a user, I can post a flat to the website, specifying its name and address
As a user, I can see detailed information of a given flat
As a user, I can edit the details of a flat if I made a mistake
As a user, I can delete a flat from the website, in case I donâ€™t want to rent it anymore

1 - Model
Generate the Flat model through the right rails generator. It should have the following columns. Feel free to add as many as you want! ðŸ˜Š

name, as a string
address, as a string
description, as a text
price_per_night, as an integer
number_of_guests, as an integer
